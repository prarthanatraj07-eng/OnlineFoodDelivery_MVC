# Online Food Delivery System (Java MVC)

A full-stack web application developed using **Java 17**, **Jakarta Servlets**, **JSP**, **JDBC**, and **MySQL**, following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

The application provides a complete food ordering experience where customers can register, browse restaurants, order food, complete payments, track deliveries, and download invoices. It also includes an administrator portal for managing restaurants, menus, customer orders, and dashboard statistics.

The frontend is built using JSP, HTML, and CSS with server-side rendering through JSP. The user interface is implemented without external UI frameworks such as Bootstrap. The project follows a layered architecture to separate presentation, business logic, and database operations, making the application easier to maintain and extend.

#  Database Design

The application uses **MySQL 8** as its relational database. The schema is designed to support user management, restaurant management, food ordering, payments, and order tracking while maintaining data integrity through primary and foreign key relationships.

### Database Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `users` | Stores customer and administrator accounts |
| `restaurants` | Stores restaurant information |
| `food_items` | Stores menu items for each restaurant |
| `cart` | Stores customer shopping carts |
| `cart_items` | Stores food items added to the cart |
| `orders` | Stores order details |
| `order_items` | Stores ordered food items |
| `payments` | Stores payment information |
| `coupons` | Stores available coupon codes |

The complete SQL script is available in:

```text
database/food_delivery_db.sql
```

   ▼
Accepted
   │
   ▼
Preparing
   │
   ▼
Food Ready
   │
   ▼
Assigned
   │
   ▼
Out for Delivery
   │
   ▼
Delivered
```

The order status is updated by the administrator and displayed to the customer through the tracking interface.

---

#  Invoice Generation

An invoice is generated after a successful order.

The invoice contains:

- Invoice Number
- Order ID
- Customer Details
- Restaurant Details
- Ordered Items
- Quantity
- Price
